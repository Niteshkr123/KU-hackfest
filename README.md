This repo is dedicated to **KU HackFest 2021**. Its an open inovation project that uses IOT as a track. We have used Raspberry pi in it.

The audio file includes the various types of test cases that will come into action as per the situation.
**Integrate All Sensors** is the whole sum up of the sensors in Raspberry pi which detect the obstacle through sensord and repond accordingly.
**IR sensor** is for detection of staircases i.e for upstairs or downstairs.
**PIR sensor** aka motion sensor file is for detection of human beings or living beings nearby them.
**Rainwater** file help us to detect the wet surface or slippery surfaces.
**Ultrasound** file helps us to detect the size and distance of obstacle from us.


To run the whole setup, **use Raspberry pi** with sensors alloted GPIO pins( mentioned in code ).
